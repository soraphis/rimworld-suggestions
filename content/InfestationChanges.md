# Infestations and Mountainbases
<sub>(Created by Soraphis: 28.9.2016)</sub>

## Insects/Vermin

If your rooms are dirty for long, there will spawn tiny insects in your rooms (which spread to other rooms)

• they give a huge mood debuff

• they spawn 4x faster in mountain bases

• after a while they leave cracks in smoothed stone

• after a while they build insect nests (which may grow to infestation hives)

(makes cleaning more important, especcially in a mountain base)

## Earthquakes

(see weather effects suggestions)

• destroys floor tiles.

• leaving cracks in smoothed stone (cant be repaired, need to have a tile above)

## Infestations

• you are not warned for an infestation untill the first aggressive insect spawns.

• **stage 1** a few cracks appear (there might already be cracks in mountains, so sometimes this is skipped)

• **stage 2** a hive spawns ontop of a crack. → generating tiny insects.

• **stage 3** after a while scarabs and spelopedes start to spawn and start expanding. (upgrade insect-nests to hives, destroying the ground and walls, ...)

• **stage 4** mega spiders start to spawn (now you should get warned)

• **stage 5** mega worms start to spawn. they dig deep holes in the ground (where more insects spawn from) and come out of another hole. those holes don't need to be inside a mountain. they are not that fast, but rly tanky. they are ranged fighter (spit accid).
when killed, they explode (not fire but accid). damaging organic and metallic things. 

• **stage 5** is the stage where the insects go hostile

## New Insectoid-Event

due to the changes to infestations a player could now prevent infestations from happen (keeping his house clean and his floors intact).

so there is a new event where 1 or more mega worms dig out the ground somewhere (possibly in your mountain base, but not neccessarily), they leave a hole where a few spelopedes and mega scarabs follow.

if not closed for too long even mega spiders will follow and the scarabs start to construct in the next-to-find place (needs to be relatively dark, and need to have a ceiling or inside a mountain)
