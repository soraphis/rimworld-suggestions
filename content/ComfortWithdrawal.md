# Comfort Withdrawal Effects
<sub>(Created by Soraphis: 16.9.2016)</sub>

## Preface

Comfort Withdrawal Effects are negativ mood points your colonists get, if they got used to something and now its gone.

## Examples

Your Cook feeds your colony with super nice `fine meals`, which gives them a mood buff ('ate tasty meal'). 
After a while, they get used to tasty meals, now imagine the scenario:

> All your `> 6 Cooks` died, so you can't make `fine meals` anymore.

When your colonists can't have tasty meals anymore they get a small debuff for it.

## (Non-Exhaustive) List of Things your Colonists get used to

- fine meals
- lavish meals
- a own room.
- tasks, if they are interested in them
   - 'i used to feed the pets - now i'm justing mining the shit out of this mountain ...'
- sculptures 
   - a sculpture might not be as beautyfull as onother one, but there might be a clonist who got attached to it.
   - colonists who are part of the "Art"-Story are more likely to get attached to the sculpture or other pieces of art.

___

The same mechanic could be applied to colonists. If one dies/is sold it will just affect other colonists that got used to the first one
