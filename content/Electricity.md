# Better Electricity System
<sub>(Created by Soraphis: 16.9.2016)</sub>

## Basic Changes

### New Wires

#### Steel Power Conduit
Power Consumption: 6

#### Gold Power Conduit

Unlocked after Research: Efficient Conduction (800 industrial Era)

50 GPC = 45 Steel + 5 Gold

Power Consumption: 2

#### Silver Power Conduit

Unlocked after Research: Efficient Conduction (800 industrial Era)

30 SPC = 20 Steel + 10 Silver

Power Consumption: 1

#### RT Super Conduit

Unlocked after Research: Super Conduction (8000 Space Era)

> Finally you managed to create a ceramic which conducts electricity without resistance at **R**oom **T**emperature

75 RTSC = 5 Plasteel + 20 Steel + 50 `<Generic Stone Block>`

Power Consumption: 0


### Power Consumption Balancing

Having 30 Tiles of Steel Wire would consume 180 power itself. That would be a bit of an balancing issue, so there should be some minor changes in the current power consumptions.

#### Things use only energy when used.

Instead of letting the stove running all day and night, your pawns should switch it on when needed and off afterwards. this should count for every workbench, like:

Tailors workbench, Smitihing Bench, Television(?), Crematorium, Cook Stove, Machining table and Electric Smelter.

## Buildings, Upgrades and Researchs

#### Research: Light Emitting Diodes (500 Industrial, Needs Colored Lights)

After that you can create LED-Lights.

Name                    | Cost       | Power Consumption | Light Amount | Range     | misc
 ----                   | ----       | ----------------- | ----------   | -----     | -----
Standing Lamp (old)     | 5 Steel    | 75W               | 60%          | 7-Tiles   | 
LED light               | 10 Steel   | 8W                | 65%          | 7-Tiles   | having an color change option - no need to build different lights


#### Research: High Efficiency Solar Panels (2000 Industrial, needs Multi-Analizer)

Name                    | Cost                      | Size  | Max Output | misc
 ----                   | ----                      | ----  | ---------- | -----
Solar Generator (old)   | 100 Steel, 3 Components   | 4x4   | 1700       | reaching max output at 100% sunlight
Photvoltaik Cell        | 50 Steel, 2 Components    | 4x2   | 1000       | reaching max output at 60% sunlight

 
#### Research: Vertical Wind Turbine (3000 Industrial, needs Multi-Analizer)

Unlocks a better Wind Turbine:

Vertical-axis wind trubine (VAWT)
