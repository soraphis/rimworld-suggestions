# Needs and Desires
<sub>(Created by Soraphis: 04.07.2018)</sub>

## Preface

This is probably an advanced version of my "Comfort Withdrawal" suggestion and its based on key elements of the Anno game-series (e.g. Anno 1404).


## Detailed Explanation

This idea is a total overhaul for the current Pawns needs. Currently there is not really a need for things like lavish meals except for raising the overall mood.
Once you've a steady food income, enough pawns that can cook simple meals and enough backup food to survive the next blight, your pawns should never hunger.

### Core Mechanics

**Needs**: Things that need to stay satisfied and responsible for most of the pawns mood.     
**Desires**: Wishes the pawn have, will grant lasting mood buffs, but the pawn will advance to higher stages with more needs.    

If needs are not satisfied, it depends on the need-stage and the pawns stage how hard the mood-hit will be.     
a pawn at stage 4 that has no stage 4 need fulfilled will have barly any mood hit.
a pawn at stage 4 that has 1 stage 1 need below 30% will have a really bad day.

#### stage 1

with stage 1 pawns are **not** able to advance skills with `no passion` above 3, skills with `interested passion` above 5 and `burning passion` above 6

So, in stage 1 your colonist will have several basic needs: **a roofed sleeping spot**, **some food**. 
Fullfilling those for a long enough period of time (e.g. keeping all needs at 50+ percent for two days in a row) will unlock 1 desire slot of the pawn.
Based on the pawns personality this desire might differ, but at stage 1 they are quite similar: **having a simple meal**, **owning a bed**, **own a bedroom**.

Fullfilling the desire, will lead to a temporary mood buff and the pawn will advance to stage 2.
Up to 3 desire slots can be unlocked (at stages 1, 2 and 4) and different amounts of desire-fullfillments are needed to advance to the next stage (1, 3, 5, 9, 15, ...)

#### stage 2

with stage 2 pawns are able to advance skills with `no passion` up to 4, skills with `interested passion` up to 7 and `burning passion` up to 8

- upgrading the need of a **roofed sleeping spot** to **having an own bedroom** consisting of:
	- 40% own room
	- 60% own bed (any quality)
- need for food will split: up to 20% satisfaction with any veg-food or cooked meat. the remaining 80% need to be at least simple meals.   
- added need for **clothing**. (might be irrelevant for nudists)    
- added need for **joy**.   

keep all needs satisfied long enough to unlock the second desire slot. after that unlocking 3 desires will advance the pawn to stage 3.
While the second desire slot is not unlocked, occasionally pawns have desires that where unlocked in prior stages, but fullfilling those desires will not gain "xp" to progress to the next stage. 
they will provide a mood buff though.

desire types that are unlocked in stage 2 include: **playing chess**, **wearing a new good+ piece of clothing**, **good+ bed**

#### stage 3

with stage 3 pawns are able to advance skills with `no passion` up to 5, skills with `interested passion` up to 9 and `burning passion` up to 10

- **having an own bedroom** will split into: 
    - 40% own room
	- 40% own bed
	- 20% (1+ pieces of [art, plants, table, chair, nightstand]
- added need for **company** (another person to chat with, or a bonded animal)

desire types that are unlocked in stage 3 include: **eat lavish meal**

#### stage 4

- **having an own bedroom** will split into: 
	- 40% own room
	- 40% own bed (good+ quality)
	- 20% (2+ pieces of [art, plants, table, chair, nightstand]
- **have a nice job** = work at something with atleast `interested passion`
	- while working at such a job: each hour increase satisfaction by 5%
	- while not workig at such a job within 24 hours: decrease by 10%
